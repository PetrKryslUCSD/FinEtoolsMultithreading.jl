# FinEtoolsMultithreading.jl

This package is an overlay  for FinEtools-based application packages. It can be
used to parallelize certain finite element operations with multithreading.

Currently, sparse matrix operators can be assembled in parallel on multiple threads. Please refer to the documentation.

## Examples

Check out the [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) documentation.
